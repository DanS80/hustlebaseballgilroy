                <img src="images/comingsoon-sf.jpeg" alt="Coach Nic Amanno" class="coach-photo">
                <div class="coach-info">
                    <h4>Nic Amanno</h4>
                    <p>For Coach Nic, baseball is far more than just a game; it's a powerful and practical teacher of life. He believes the sport builds character, teaching loyalty, commitment, and hard work in a unique way that prepares young players for success in any career. His coaching philosophy is centered on ensuring the players have fun and develop a true love for the game while getting better each day. He focuses on a "building block" approach to learning, especially with hitting, believing that positive self-talk and self-belief are the most important qualities for a young player to develop.</p>
                    <p>Coach Nic's journey in baseball is a remarkable one. It started simply, with his dad signing him up for tee-ball. What captivated him from the start was the unique blend of individual skill and teamwork the sport demands. As a player, he was an All-American relief pitcher for Cuesta Community College, where he helped lead his team to the state final four. He then earned a full scholarship to pitch for Chico State, helping his team reach the NCAA Division II World Series and being named National Pitcher of the Week twice. While those achievements are a source of pride, his greatest joy now comes from coaching. As he puts it, his proudest moment is simply hearing a player say they liked his coaching and felt they improved because of it.</p>
                    <p>His connection to the team is personal, as he is the proud dad of his son, Nolan. He hopes to be a positive influence in the lives of young players and their families, aspiring to become a true part of the Gilroy baseball community for many years to come. When he's not at the ballpark, you can find him enjoying time with his family, BBQing, or doing yard work. But as he says, his dream job is either coaching baseball or being a field crew member, adding, "I would be at the ballpark all day every day if I could."</p>

                    <h4>Dan Stilts</h4>
                    <p>Coach Dan's journey with baseball began at a young age, playing every day with friends in his neighborhood. That simple love for the game led him to join a team in the fourth grade, where he gravitated toward pitching, second base, and first base.</p>
                    <p>His coaching story started in tee-ball, helping out with his oldest son, Eli's, team. After witnessing some negative experiences with other coaches over the next couple of years, Coach Dan was inspired to step up and provide a more positive environment. He found his true calling coaching his youngest son, Evan's, 8U Little League team, where he loved helping kids grow and improve while having fun.</p>
                    <p>Coach Dan's philosophy is centered on being a positive role model. He believes the most crucial qualities for a young player are confidence and resilience. He teaches kids to believe in themselves, to embrace failure as part of the process, and to understand that sportsmanship is just as important as the final score.</p>
                    <p>A proud member of the Gilroy baseball community for over five years, Coach Dan is honored to be coaching his son, Evan, on the 10U team and to be a part of his son, Eli's, baseball journey on the 11U team. When he's not at the field, he enjoys cooking, grilling, or creating custom pieces in his wood and metal shop. He also loves relaxing on the lake with his family.</p>
